Getting help
============

   SPICE tutorials are available on the NAIF web site:

      http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/

   The following tutorials may be of particular interest:

      Intro to Kernel Files
      PCK (Planetary cartographic and physical constants)
      FK (Reference frame specifications)

   Also see the following Required Reading documents provided
   with the SPICE Toolkit:

      Frames      
      Kernel
      PCK

   Many SPICE kernels contain internal documentation. Text kernels may
   be viewed with a text editor or web browser. Comments in binary
   kernels may be viewed using the SPICE utility COMMNT. Coverage of
   binary PCKs may be viewed using the SPICE utility SPACIT. See the
   COMMNT and SPACIT User's Guides (provided with the SPICE Toolkit)
   for details.
