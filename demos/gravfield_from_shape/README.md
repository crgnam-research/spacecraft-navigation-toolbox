# Generating a Gravity Field from a Shape Model

## Overview:
This demo illustrates:
- How to load in a .OBJ file as a `ShapeModel`
- How to use `ShapeModel` to create a dense sphere packing of the given mode
- How to use `GravityField` to generate a representative gravity field of the object using using a finite sphere approach 
- How to use `GravityField` to generate a spherical harmonic model that fits the field generated by the finite sphere approach
- How a gravity field could be visualized

## Included Data:
- `bennu.obj`: a .OBJ file of the asteroid 101955 Bennu 

## Demo Specific Code:
- `gravfield_from_shape.m`: The demo script
