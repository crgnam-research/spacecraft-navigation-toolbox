This is a collection of MATLAB utilities for simulating spacecraft navigation scenarios.  It provides the tools for both simulating spacecraft vehicle dynamics, simulating sensor measurements, and provides a suite of filteirng tools for optimal estimation.

# How to Install/Use:
## Dependencies:
While most 3rd party libraries are included in `lib/`, some functionality of this toolkit also depends on the JPL's SPICE Toolkit.  If you wish to use any SPICE kernels, you will need to install the [Spice Toolkit's MATLAB bindings](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_MATLAB.html).

## Get up and Running:
*Coming Soon*

## Demos:
In order to make this code as accesible and easy to use as possible, several well documented demo files have been included.  These files aim to demonstrate the key functionalities, and also show how to effectively use the code found here.

*Coming Soon*
